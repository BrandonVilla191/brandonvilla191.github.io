# CS7641: Project Proposal
## Introduction
ML in agriculture uses image analysis to detect diseases early, boosting crop health and yields. It works by training models on data (images of healthy & diseased plants) to identify disease patterns. Existing literature includes Ramcharan et al. which explores the use of deep learning for detecting disease in Cassava (major staple in Africa) [1]. They used transfer learning to construct a deep CNN to identify a few different diseases on this crop to somewhat accurate results. In a paper by Ferentinos, they use CNNs to identify diseases on the leaves of plants [2]. In a paper by Mohanty et al. they looked at 26 diseases across 14 plant species and achieved a model in training with an accuracy of 99.35% [3]. Our dataset (Five Crop Diseases Dataset) contains images of five different crops, with each crop containing healthy and diseased images. For example, diseases for corn include common rust, gray leaf spot, and northern leaf blight. Overall, there are 17 classes (crop x disease combination) and over 13,000 images.

## Problem Statement
We're focusing on the challenge of quickly and accurately identifying diseases in crops like corn using machine learning. This issue is critical because crop diseases can lead to major losses in yield and quality, significantly impacting the economy. Our goal is to create a tool to help farmers easily detect these diseases, leading to better decision-making, healthier crops, and increased productivity.

The motivation behind our project is clear: current disease detection methods in agriculture are often slow and require expert knowledge, which might not be readily available to all farmers. By using our machine learning model, we can offer a more efficient and accessible solution. Our extensive dataset, which includes thousands of images of both healthy and diseased plants, serves as the foundation for developing a model that aims for high accuracy in disease identification.

The goal of our project is to transform agricultural practices. With our machine learning tool, farmers can quickly identify and address crop diseases, saving time and reducing economic losses. This not only benefits individual farmers but also contributes to the broader goal of ensuring food security and sustainability in the agricultural sector.

## Methods
For this midterm, we implemented a kmeans model

## Metrics 
Some quantitative metrics for the Convolutional Neural Network would be accuracy (% of correctly classified images), precision (proportion of true positives), recall (proportion of true positives among true positives), F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), and the loss function (cross-entropy loss in training). 

Similarly, for the SVM, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (quantified ability to distinguish between classes) would be good metrics to track. 

For K-Means Clustering, the silhouette coefficient (similarity within clusters compared to between clusters) and the Calinski-Harabasz index (separation between clusters) will be used as metrics.


### Goals
- Achieve high accuracy (>90%) in classifying.
- Maintain a balanced precision and recall with F1-score (>85%).
- Minimize the loss function value.
- Achieve a high AUC (>0.9) for class separation.
- Achieve a high silhouette coefficient (>0.5).
- Maintain high Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin indices (>1).

### Expected Results
The CNN should accurately distinguish between healthy and diseased crops, with minimal misclassifications.
